Architecture standard: Clean Architecture + DDD-Lite

Layers (strict order):
1. Domain
2. Application
3. Infrastructure
4. Interfaces (API, CLI, UI)

Rules:
- Dependencies only point inward
- Domain layer has ZERO framework imports
- Application layer depends only on Domain
- Infrastructure implements interfaces defined in Application or Domain

Domain rules:
- Entities contain behavior, not just data
- Value Objects are immutable
- Aggregates enforce invariants
- Domain Services only when behavior does not belong to an Entity

Application rules:
- Use Cases are verbs (e.g. CalculateDriverProfit)
- No business rules in controllers
- No persistence logic
- Use Unit of Work explicitly

Infrastructure rules:
- ORM models are not Domain entities
- Mapping layer is mandatory
- Repositories are adapters, not abstractions of the database

Bounded Context:
- One domain = one bounded context
- No shared database schemas across contexts
