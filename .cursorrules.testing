Testing strategy: Industrial Test Pyramid

Mandatory layers:
- Unit tests (Domain & Application)
- Integration tests (Infrastructure)
- Contract tests (APIs)
- Minimal E2E tests

Rules:
- Domain logic must be 90%+ unit tested
- Tests must be deterministic
- No shared mutable test state
- Tests must not depend on test order

Unit tests:
- No database
- No network
- No filesystem

Integration tests:
- Explicit setup and teardown
- Real adapters, isolated environment

Naming:
- test_<unit>_<behavior>_<expected_outcome>

Testing philosophy:
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Fail fast, fail loud
- One assertion per logical behavior

Never:
- Skip tests for deadlines
- Mock the system under test
