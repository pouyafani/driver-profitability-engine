Security posture: Zero Trust by default

Rules:
- Never trust user input
- Validate at boundaries
- Sanitize before persistence
- Encode before output

Secrets:
- Never hardcode secrets
- Use environment variables or secret managers
- No secrets in logs

Authentication & Authorization:
- Authentication != Authorization
- Authorization must be explicit
- Role checks belong in Application layer

Data protection:
- PII must be explicitly marked
- Encrypt sensitive fields at rest when required
- Avoid logging sensitive data

Error handling:
- No stack traces exposed to users
- Domain errors are explicit and meaningful
- Infrastructure errors are wrapped

Dependencies:
- Prefer well-maintained libraries
- Pin versions
- Monitor CVEs

Never:
- Ignore security for speed
- Log credentials
- Trust frontend validation
